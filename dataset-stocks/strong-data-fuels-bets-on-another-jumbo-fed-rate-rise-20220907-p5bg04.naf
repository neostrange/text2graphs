Data showing the US services sector expanded in August at its fastest pace in four months has soothed concerns that the world’s largest economy is in recession and opened the door for another supersized rate rise by the Federal Reserve this month.

The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) services index unexpectedly nudged up 0.2 percentage points to 56.9, against consensus expectations for a decline to 55.3, from 56.7 in July. The 50-point level separates expansion and contraction.
Measures of business activity and new orders both recorded their strongest readings of the year, indicating that demand for services has held up in the face of soaring inflation and rising interest rates.

Traders sharpened their expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver a third consecutive three quarters of a percentage point rate rise at its policy meeting this month, pricing in a 72 per cent chance that will occur.

The Reserve Bank lifted the cash rate by 0.5 per cent to 2.35 per cent on Tuesday, as expected, and indicated more increases over the months ahead.
“[It] was a classic case where good news is bad news, as the ISM reveals the services sector of the US economy is in rude health, implying the Fed still has more work to do to bring inflation under control,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank.

The services data follows the release of the ISM’s manufacturing survey last week which showed that activity also grew steadily in August, easing concerns of a severe economic contraction in the US.
“The slight rise in the ISM services index ... strikes a further blow against the idea the economy is close to recession,” said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics.

Mr Hunter said the two ISM surveys are consistent with GDP growth of around 3 per cent annualised which is in line with Capital Economics’ forecast for the third quarter.

S&P Global Market Intelligence upgraded its 2022 forecast for real GDP growth in the US to 1.7 per cent, from 1.5 per cent. It also reduced its forecast for 2023 to 0.9 per cent growth, from 1 per cent.

“Recent data clarify the economy is not in recession,” agreed Joel Prakken, co-head of US economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The better-than-expected services data sparked a sell-off in Treasuries, with the yield on the 30-year note rising to its highest level since 2014. The US 10-year bond yield jumped 15 basis points to 3.35 per cent, while the yield on the two-year Treasury rose 11 basis points to 3.5 per cent.

Expectations of another supersized rate rise by the Fed pushed the US dollar to a fresh 20-year high, weighing on the local currency, which dropped nearly 1 per cent to US67.35¢.

All three major benchmarks on Wall Street tumbled amid concerns that further aggressive tightening by the US central bank will stunt economic growth. The S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1 per cent at the open on Wednesday.
Investors remain divided on whether the world’s largest economy will fall into recession despite GDP contracting in the first half of the year.

BlackRock believes the only way the Federal Reserve can bring inflation back to its target range will be crushing demand with a recession. It said this will likely occur early next year.

“The Fed will be surprised by the growth damage caused by its tightening. When the Fed sees this pain, we think it will stop raising rates,” said Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute.

“It will be too late to avoid a contraction in economic activity by then, we think, but the decrease won’t be deep enough to bring PCE inflation down to the Fed’s target of 2 per cent. Instead, we expect inflation to persist close to 3 per cent.”

Markets will turn their attention to Fed chairman Jerome Powell, and vice chair Lael Brainard who are both speaking this week before the central bank enters a black-out period on Saturday.
